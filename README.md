# -Besiege-Mod-Modern-Air-Combat
## Goal
This mod concentrates on simulating modern air combat in Besiege, with a balanced trade-off between fidelity of simulation and performance cost.

## Blocks
### Already have
- Radar, detecting targets by scanning over a sector. (Displaying scan region in Multiplayer and level editor is currently disabled)
- Displayer, showing the targets that the radar detected, can lock a target and control the radar to keep track of it; The default mode is TWS(Track While Search). Also, the width and orientation of the radar sanner can be adjusted manually.
- RWR, altering you when your machine was scanned by a radar, also displaying the relative orientation of the radar source.
- SRAAM, short-range air-to-air missiles, launch it whenever you want, the closer to your target, the better.
- MRAAM, medium-range air-to-air missiles, launch it when you has locked a target, deal with targets far away.
- Flare launcher, releases flare disruptor, can distract missles coming to attack.
- Machine gun.
- HUD, displays some basic flight information and when locking a target, provides a circle to assist aiming the gun.
- Stick, enable mouse control.
